1. Understand the JK Flip-Flop Behavior
Truth table

Functionality on clock edge

Asynchronous reset (if any)

2. Write Verilog Code for JK Flip-Flop (Design Under Test - DUT)
Inputs: J, K, clk, reset
Output: Q

Use always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)

3. Create Testbench File
No ports (testbenches are self-contained)

Declare reg signals for inputs and wire for output

Instantiate the DUT

Apply stimulus (various test cases for J and K combinations)

Use $monitor or $display for printing

Include a clock generation block

4. Simulate the Design
Use EDA Tool like ModelSim, Vivado, or Xilinx ISE

Compile both DUT and testbench

Run the simulation

View output using waveform viewer

5. Analyze the Waveform
Check behavior for:

J=0, K=0 → Hold

J=0, K=1 → Reset

J=1, K=0 → Set

J=1, K=1 → Toggle

Reset condition

6. Debug if Needed
Check signal transitions

Correct any bugs in logic or timing

7. Document Your Findings
Include simulation screenshots

Mention test scenarios and outputs

Note observations or issues fixed
